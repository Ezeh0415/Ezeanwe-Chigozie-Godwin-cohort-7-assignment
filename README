Dificulty encounterd

1. Mongoose Schema validation: This was my first time using mongoose, and I encountered a few issues with schema validation. I had to spend some time understanding how to properly set up and use mongoose schemas

2. Database creation: as i had only used mongodb before without schemas it was hard for me to understand how to specify with collection i want my data to go to.

3. Mongoose connection: I had to spend some time understanding how to properly set up and use mongoose connection.

4. JWT token: I had made you of jwt token before but never did it as a reusable middleware and i am still yet to understand how to refresh my jwt token to avoid hackers and to keep the users save

5. i had to test the project the front end way cause i still have a hard time understanding thunderclient or postman

i cant call all the issues little cause i did spend a lot learning and fixing them i had the joy of watching my project work and i am happy with the result
